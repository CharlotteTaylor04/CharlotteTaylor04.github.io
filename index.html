                <h2>10 fun facts about cats</h2>

                <p><b>Cats can make over 100 sounds</b></p>
                <p>Unlike dogs, which can only make around 10 different sounds, cats are able to produce more than 100 distinct vocalisations. This variety helps them to communicate with humans and express a wide range of emotions</p>
                <p><b>Cats only meow for humans</b></p>
                <p>While kittens meow to communicate with their mothers, adult cats typically don't meow at each other. Meowing is primarily for communicating with humans, often to express their needs or attention.</p>
                <p><b>They have a dominant paw</b></p>
                <p>This is an attribute that is also found within humans regarding dominant hands. They are either left or right pawed.</p>
                <p><b>Cats can't taste sweetness</b></p>
                <p>Unlike humans and many other animals that favour sweetness, cats don't have the taste receptors to detect this. They are carnivores meaning their bodies are specifically designed to thrive on a meat-based diet whereas humans are omnivores resulting in a diet which involves many more tastes.</p>
                <p><b>Their whiskers are super sensitive</b></p>
                <p>Cat whiskers are packed with nerve endings that help them to detect changes in their environment. These whiskers are so sensitive that they are able to detect changes in air currents, helping cats navigate their surroundings, especially in the dark.</p>
                <p><b>They can jump up to six times their length</b></p>
                <p>Cats have powerful leg muscles and a flexible spine helping them to leap up to six times their body length. This makes them excellent climbers and hunters</p>
                <p><b>Their noses are unique, like fingerprints</b></p>
                <p>No cat has the same nose, just like no human has the same fingerprint. Each cat has a specific pattern of ridges and bumps which sets them apart from one another.</p>
                <p><b>Cats spend 70% of their time sleeping</b></p>
                <p>Cats spend around 12 to 16 hours a day sleeping. This is because they are predators by nature and must conserve energy to hunt in short, intense bursts. Whilst most cats today are pets or socialised, this still applies to wild cats such as cheetahs and tigers.</p>
                <p><b>Their eyes glow in the dark</b></p>
                <p>Cats have a layer of cells called the tapetum lucidum in their eyes, which reflects light and enhances their night vision.</p>
                <p><b>Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees</b></p>
                <p>Their ears contain 32 muscles each which allows them to swivel and rotate up to 180 degrees. This ability helps them to detect almost silent sounds which contributes to their ability of being excellent hunters.</p>
